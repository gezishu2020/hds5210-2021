Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

I recognize you've had a very difficult semester, and I want to commend you for your commitment to sticking through your school work.  Please recognize that the critiques below are for your continued growth and do not reflect any concern I have about a lack of effort on your part.

As a note, not every cell in your notebook needed to have the ### BEGIN SOLUTION and ### END SOLUTION.  Those are comments only and I used them during assignments to help guide work.  They have no value beyond that.

While your techniques in working with the data were fine, without any documentation, it was unclear to me what conclusions you were trying to draw or did draw from the data.
